# Project Structure

It may be confusing to get started, due to the sheer scale of this application, and may deter a lot of people. Fret not! We have a series of steps:

1. Find a part of the project that you may be interested to contribute to. We have a detailed list of all active and passive projects [here](ACTIVE.md)
2. Go through the structure of the project [here](STRUCTURE.md), you will get a better feel for how the moving gears fit together
3. Read our conventions [here](CONVENTION.md)!. Be aware that we have specific conventions to name files and folders to prevent the project from becoming unmanageable.
